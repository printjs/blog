# : Use Your Editor to Interrogate and Explore the Type System

When you install TypeScript, you get two executables:
* tsc, the TypeScript compiler
* tsserver, the TypeScript standalone server

## Things to Remember
* Take advantage of the TypeScript language services by using an editor that sup‐ports them.
* Use your editor to build an intuition for how the type system works and how TypeScript infers types.
* Familiarize yourself with TypeScript’s refactoring tools, e.g., renaming symbols and files.
* Know how to jump into type declaration files to see how they model behavior.
