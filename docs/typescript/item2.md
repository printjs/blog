# Typescript Options You're Using.

* noImplicitAny
* strictNullChecks

## Things to Remember
* The TypeScript compiler includes several settings that affect core aspects of the language.
* Configure TypeScript using tscong.json rather than command-line options.
* Turn on noImplicitAny unless you are transitioning a JavaScript project to TypeScript.
* Use strictNullChecks to prevent “undefined is not an object”-style runtime errors.
* Aim to enable strict to get the most thorough checking that TypeScript can offer.
