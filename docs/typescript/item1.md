# What Is Typescript

> ***Typescript is type superset of Javascript***

## Things to remember

* TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript: all JavaScript programs are syntactically valid TypeScript programs, but not all TypeScript programs are valid JavaScript programs.
* TypeScript adds a static type system that models JavaScriptâ€™s runtime behavior and tries to spot code that will throw exceptions at runtime.
* It is possible for code to pass the type checker but still throw at runtime.
* TypeScript disallows some legal but questionable JavaScript constructs such as calling functions with the wrong number of arguments.
* Type annotations tell TypeScript your intent and help it distinguish correct and incorrect code
