## After absolutely **owning the stage** with BLACKPINK in 2023 with their headlining performance, Lisa and Jennie are back at Coachella this year - only this time, they're going solo. It's the kind of glow-up moment fans have been waiting for, watching the two superstars **break out** on their own after years of dominating as part of the ultimate K-pop **powerhouse**.

## But as Jennie **rips through** her solo catalog, fans can't help but notice that something's a little off. The internet is **buzzing** with rumors about how Coachella might be playing favorites, arguing that the festival gave a bigger and better treatment to Lisa.

## Fans noticed that Lisa performed on the recently expanded Sahara Tent-**aka** the second-biggest **flex** at the festival - with wild visuals, immaculate lighting, and better equipment. Jennie, meanwhile, put on an electrifying performance on the Outdoor Theatre Stage, which has more of an old-school, stripped-down vibe.
