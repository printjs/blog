## After absolutely **owning the stage** with BLACKPINK in 2023 with their headlining performance, Lisa and Jennie are back at Coachella this year - only this time, they're going solo. It's the kind of glow-up moment fans have been waiting for, watching the two superstars **break out** on their own after years of dominating as part of the ultimate K-pop **powerhouse**.

## But as Jennie **rips through** her solo catalog, fans can't help but notice that something's a little off. The internet is **buzzing** with rumors about how Coachella might be playing favorites, arguing that the festival gave a bigger and better treatment to Lisa.

## Fans noticed that Lisa performed on the recently expanded Sahara Tent-**aka** the second-biggest **flex** at the festival - with wild visuals, immaculate lighting, and better equipment. Jennie, meanwhile, put on an electrifying performance on the Outdoor Theatre Stage, which has more of an old-school, stripped-down vibe.

### 继 2023 年与 BLACKPINK 一起在科切拉音乐节的舞台上大放异彩之后，Lisa 和 Jennie 今年又将在科切拉音乐节上单飞。这正是歌迷们期待已久的光辉时刻，看着这两位超级巨星在作为终极 K-pop 强队的一员称霸多年后，独自突破自我。
 
### 但是，当詹妮在她的个人专辑中大放异彩时，歌迷们不禁发现有些不对劲。网上盛传科切拉音乐节（Coachella）可能在偏袒丽莎，认为该音乐节给了丽莎更大更好的待遇。
 
### 歌迷们注意到，丽莎是在最近扩建的撒哈拉帐篷上表演的--也就是音乐节上第二大的柔性舞台--那里有狂野的视觉效果、完美的灯光和更好的设备。而詹妮则在户外剧场舞台上进行了一场震撼人心的演出，该舞台更具老派、简约的风格。
