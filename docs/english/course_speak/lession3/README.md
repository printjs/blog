## After reading the comments, I am sure Trump is Making China Great Again. China has never been supported by so many people in so many countries.Trump may have the "Art Of The Deal" but China has mastered the "Art Of War". They are about to teach America some lessons we may not want to learn.

## I am Japanese and I always was suspicious of China, but today I feel admiration for China. I'm happy that at least one Asian country stands up to Trump and his bullying. Canadian here. If you had told me a year ago that one day I would be cheering on China and criticizing the US, I would’ve said you were insane. Yet here we are.

## The U.S. keeps saying China made money off the trade surplus — but they never admit it’s been China’s cheap and quality goods that have long propped up the dollar and the comfort of the American lifestyle.Hats off to China. This is how a world leader should act. Courageous and righteous in their act. Never bow down to a bully like Trump. China is giving us some hopes. China is showing the entire world what having backbone looks like.

- trade surplus 贸易顺差 
- trade deficit 贸易逆差
- Hats off 脱帽致敬🫡

### 看了这些评论，我确信特朗普正在让中国再次伟大。中国从未得到过这么多国家这么多人的支持。特朗普可能掌握了 “交易的艺术”，但中国掌握了 “战争的艺术”。他们即将给美国上一些我们可能不想上的课。
 
### 我是日本人，我一直怀疑中国，但今天我对中国感到钦佩。我很高兴至少有一个亚洲国家站出来反对特朗普和他的霸权主义。我是加拿大人。如果你在一年前告诉我，有一天我会为中国欢呼并批评美国，我会说你疯了。然而，我们在这里。
 
### 美国一直说中国从贸易顺差中赚了钱--但他们从不承认，长期以来，正是中国物美价廉的商品支撑着美元和美国人舒适的生活方式。向中国致敬！这才是世界领袖应有的表现。有勇气，有正义感。永远不要向特朗普这样的恶霸低头。中国给了我们一些希望。中国正在向全世界展示什么是有骨气。
